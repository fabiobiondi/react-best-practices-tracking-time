    * Folders: kebab-case
    * Components: PascalCase
    * Extensions: .jsx for React files, .js for ES6 modules
    * Close Every Element <br />
* Bind functions in the constructor methods (ok we should but I don't like this too much : )
* keep it simple. LIFT
* Organize your apps in components
* Keep your components small
* Stateful containers and stateless UI components
* Separate your business logic from UI and interaction logic
* Write functional component
* Increase performance with Pure Components and shouldComponentUpdate()
* Use an immutable state
* Use a state manager, such as Redux or Mobx State Tree
* Check your properties with PropTypes validation
* Take advantage from JSX
* React and Redux dev tools
* Code Splitting and Lazy Loading for your routes (i.e. React Loadable)
* Use React pattern such as HoC (Higher ORder Components) and render props
* Test your Code

* Avoid Refs when possible
* CSS: inline, styled or external CSS? Use what you prefer : )

NOTE:
